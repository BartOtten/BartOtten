### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bart Otten, software developer by day and scode writer by
night. The projects at my GitHub range from production ready packages
to proof of concepts.

Unfortunately, often I don't notice open issues or pull requests in
the repos I maintain. Please contact me through telegram (@bart_otten)
if I don't respond in in a couple of days.
